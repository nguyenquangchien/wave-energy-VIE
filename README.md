# An assessment on potential wave power along a coastal province, Central Vietnam

The Excel file `Calculate_Pn.xlsx` is for compute the distribution of wave power along the 30 m contour for various wave conditions. Inside this file there are also the coordinate points of this contour. 

The Excel file `Wave_characteristics_by_season_long-term_Phu_Yen.xlsx` summarizes the wave power for different months and season for the local coastal area. 

The Excel file `Goodness-of-fit.xlsx` presented measured and computed data, along with Nash, RMSE and BSS indices.
